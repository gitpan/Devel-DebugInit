WHAT
====
Devel::DebugInit attempts to give developers an extremely simple and
automated way of creating debugger initialization files specific for a
given project. These initialization files contain user-defined
functions built from header file macro definitions.

By calling new(), the files specified by the 'filenames' parameter is
parsed by the C preprocessor, and all macros #define'd in the file (and
if desired, all macros #define'd in all files #include'd in that file),
will be parsed and expanded. By then calling the print() method, these
macros can be written out to an output file in the format of
user-defined functions specific for that debugger.

By automating the process, a new file can be created whenever the code
of a project changes, and that way there will not be antiquated copies
lying around to trap the unwary.

INSTALL
=======

Devel::DebugInit::*
---
In order to write out an initialization file, you will need one of the
debugger specific backends. The GDB backend is supplied with the
module (and it is currently the only one available ;-). So if this
works for you, great! If you are interested in writing a backend for a
different debugger, please volunteer!

C::Scan - Data::Flow
-----
You will need the C-Scan, version 0.4 or better, as well as
Data-Flow, version 0.05 or better, in order to use these modules. These
can be gotten at your favorite CPAN site: 

ftp any-CPAN-site 
cd CPAN/authors/id/JASONS/
bin
get C-Scan-0.4.tar.gz 
get Data-Flow-0.05.tar.gz 

unpack the tar files anywhere you wish.

then for each module:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make 
   make test 
   	(presuming you are satisfied)
   make install

Devel::DebugInit and Devel::DebugInit::GDB
---
unpack the tar file anywhere you wish.

When you have an up-to-date C::Scan and Data::Flow installed:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make 
   make test 
   	(presuming you are satisfied)
   make install

RUNNING
=======
Read the included pod documentation and see ./test.pl and
DebugInit/test.pl to get an idea of how to use this module.

NOTES
=====
There are currently a number of ways to customize the output of this
program, but if you can think of more useful ones, let me know!
