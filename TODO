It might be a bug that I don't look to see if there is an opening '('
following a token in resolve(). I need to find out if you can have
both a simple macro and a macro with args with the same name.

Come up with a better way to resolve macros from #include'd system
header files, <stdio.h>, and user header files,
"mystring.h". Currently we're restricted to the functionality that
C::Scan provides, but maybe it can be augmented.
