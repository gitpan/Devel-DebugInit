It might be a bug that I don't look to see if there is an opening '('
following a token in resolve(). I need to find out if you can have
both a simple macro and a macro with args with the same name.

Decide what to do about macro's with a leading underscore:
1) Turned off by default in scan(), with a global variable for control.
2) Turned off in &define_(no_)args, with a variable to control.
